This is a Coq implementation of the paper *A completeness proof for geometrical logic* by Thierry Coquand.

A geometrical theory is a particular kind of first-order theory where all axioms have a special shape reminiscent of Prolog clauses. Namely, they are all of the form `∀x. Φ → ∨_i ∃y_i. Ψ_i` where the formulae are conjunctions of atoms. The theorem from the paper is that any proof of a closed atomic formula in such a theory can be turned into a *dynamical proof*, which is essentially an inductive tree with higher-order branches. Computationally, it means that each call to an axiom of the geometrical theory is turned into an inert node in a tree branching over the disjunction index of that axiom.

This implementation follows the argument of the paper, which is essentially the building of a Beth model (i.e. proof-irrelevant sheaves), with a few tweaks. Instead of considering sets of fomulae, we use ordered lists. Manipulation of presheaves is alleviated thanks to the well-known strictification trick of an arbitrary category, i.e. replacing morphisms by their Yoneda embedding and getting definitional associativity and identity laws for free. Since we do not care about the computational adequacy of the resulting model, we do not have to care for presheaf naturality nor sheaf unicity. This results in a straightforward axiom-free Coq implementation that computes trees at the end of the day.
